## Application

In this sample application we find a angular client authorizing against an STS getting a token and asking an ASP.NET Core WebAPI for data.

The STS can be found here [https://github.com/FabianGosebrink/security-token-service](https://github.com/FabianGosebrink/security-token-service)

Find the client in the `client` folder and the ASP.NET Core WebAPI in the `server` folder.

Get the backend running by

```
dotnet run
```

and the frontend by

```
npm install
```

and

```
npm start
```
